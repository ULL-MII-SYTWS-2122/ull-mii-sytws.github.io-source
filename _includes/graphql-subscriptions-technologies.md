To understand the fundamental of Subscriptions is convenient to  know these three technologies:

1. [EventEmitter]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/event-emitters).  
  - Review the chapter on 
[EventEmitter]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/event-emitters)s.
  - If you want to practice more with the event emitters you can **optionally** do the lab
[networking]({{site.baseurl}}/tema2-async/practicas/networking/). 
2. Another concept that you have to know before going to GraphQL subscriptions is Async Generators. You can **optionally** do the lab [Async Generators]({{site.baseurl}}/practicas/first-come-first-served-for-await)
3. The third technoloy that it is convenient for you to know is websockets. You can **optionally** do the lab [Websockets]({{site.baseurl}}/practicas/websockets)
