To understand the fundamental of Subscriptions is convenient to  know these three technologies:

1. [EventEmitter]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/event-emitters).  
  - Review the chapter on 
[EventEmitter]({{site.baseurl}}/pages/event-emitters)s.
  - If you want to practice more with the event emitters you can **optionally** do the lab
[networking]({{site.baseurl}}/tema2-async/practicas/networking/). 
2. Another concept that you have to know before going to GraphQL subscriptions is Async Generators. 
   If  you don't feel confident about async generators, review these lessons:

   * Chapter [Async iteration and generators](https://javascript.info/async-iterators-generators) of JavaScript.info (see also the repo <https://github.com/ULL-MII-SYTWS-2021/learning-async-iteration-and-generators>)
   * Chapter [Iterables](https://javascript.info/iterable) of JavaScript.info
   * Chapter [Generators](https://javascript.info/generators) of JavaScript.info
   * And then **optionally** do the lab [Async Generators: First Come First Served For Await]({{site.baseurl}}/practicas/first-come-first-served-for-await) to know more about async generators.

3. The third technoloy that it is convenient for you to know is websockets. You can **optionally** do the lab [Websockets]({{site.baseurl}}/practicas/websockets)
